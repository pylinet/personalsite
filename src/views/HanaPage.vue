  companyabout:
    "CBRE, the worldâ€™s largest global commercial real estate services firm, started a wholly-owned subsidiary called Hana, which focused on delivering co-working spaces across the world. The vision was to create inspiring and comfortable environments for our members to work, meet, and collaborate. Every Hana space consists of a mix of private team suites, conference rooms, and shared workspaces and lounges, all designed to give maximum flexibility and customization to Hana members. As the first Senior Designer on the physical product team, I worked directly under the VP of Product Design to launch our first Revit and BIM workflow, which would eventually develop into a robust set of standards that supported 5 team members and +10 submitted plan sets across the team. As a Design Manager, I spearheaded documenting our space standards to ensure consistency and alignment across the company.",
